NOTES:
Once you finished, you dont need to repeat all steps when Mantis stops working,
you just have to open Termux, paste commad line in step 12, and hit Enter, it will activate Mantis again

Due this is not a Mantis devs official method to activate Mantis app,you NEED to repeat this process (from step 5)
every time you restart your phone

The most you repeat this process, more easier and natural it will be

Next time you restart your phone, you just need to start from the 5th step
